These files are meant to aid students and instructors in performing nonlinear data fitting to enzyme kinetics. 
The ".nb" file can be loaded into Mathematica, while the ".ipynb" can be loaded into a Jupyter Notebook.
The remaining ".csv" files contain sample data so readers can attempt to perform data fitting.
When ready, the .csv files can be replaced to fit any enzyme kinetic data.
You can find a full description on performing data fitting in the article entitled "From Classroom to Publication: Improving Enzyme Kinetic Constant Estimation and Visualization" (submitted)
